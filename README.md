This is a project using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)  I will compare different machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines) to see what would provide the best classification results in differentiating malignant tumors from benign tumors.
